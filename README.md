# anarchygrabber3-check
Checks if the AnarchyGrabber3 malware has infected the current machine's installation of Discord.

Written in Python 3.7.3.

The script checks if the index.js file has been modified in the current installation of Discord and warns the user if anything is wrong, and what they should do if they are infected.

An executable is included, tested on Windows 10 and compiled using [auto-py-to-exe](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe). Users with Python 3 already installed on their machines can just run the .py script.
